				<h4>Generate Stat Rolls</h4>
				<div>
					To create a character you will first need to create your stat rolls.  You can do this by going to {{ HTML::link('/user/characters/roll', 'The roll generation page') }}.  This page will generate 10 rolls randomly for you.
					<br />
					<br />
					You must get a character approved before you can generate a new set of rolls.  Once they are created, they cannot be re-rolled.
				</div>
				<br />
				<h4>Create your character</h4>
				<div>
					Once you have your rolls, you can begin to create your character.  Your character will be editable only until it is approved for a game.  At that time, your rolls will be erased and your character will no longer be fully editable.
					<br />
					<br />
					The default method of character creation assumes you will be creating your character on paper first and simply inputting the data into the site for approval.  A more comprehensive character creation is in the works.  This page will be updated when it is finished.
				</div>
				<br />
				<h4>Spells</h4>
				<div>
					Once your character has been created, you can request any spells (if needed) by clicking the spell book link on the same line as your character.  Once there, click on "Request Spell".  After you request a spell it will have to be approved by a game master before your character has it.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you request a spell before your character has been approved for a game, it will be automatically approved when your character is approved.
